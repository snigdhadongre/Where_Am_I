# Where_Am_I

Welcome to the localization project! In this project, you will learn to utilize ROS packages to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a provided map in the Gazebo and RViz simulation environments.

Over the course of this lesson, you will learn about several aspects of robotics with a focus on ROS, including -

1. Building a mobile robot for simulated tasks.

2. Creating a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a Gazebo world and utilizes packages like AMCL and the Navigation Stack.

3. Exploring, adding, and tuning specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results.
